Hotel Details: Users can view detailed information about a particular hotel, including its amenities, room types, and prices. They can also see photos of the hotel and read reviews from other guests.

Booking: Users can select a room type and specify the number of rooms they want to book. They can then proceed to the booking page where they enter their personal information, such as name, email, and credit card details, to confirm the reservation.

Reservation Management: Users can manage their reservations by accessing the "My Reservations" section. Here, they can view their existing bookings, modify or cancel reservations, and check their booking status.
